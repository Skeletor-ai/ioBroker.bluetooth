2026-02-19 18:08 - dm-utils refactor complete

## Changes made:

### 1. npm install @iobroker/dm-utils
- Package installed and added to package.json dependencies

### 2. lib/bluetoothDeviceManagement.js (NEW)
- DeviceManagement subclass with all required methods:
  - listDevices(): Returns adopted + discovered devices with connect/disconnect/pair/unpair/remove actions
  - getInstanceInfo(): apiVersion v1, scan + allowNewDevices actions
  - handleInstanceAction(): Toggle discovery scan
  - handleDeviceAction(): connect, disconnect, pair, unpair, remove (with confirmation)
  - getDeviceDetails(): JsonFormSchema panel with device info, signal, connection status, advertisement data

### 3. main.js integration
- Imported BluetoothDeviceManagement
- Instantiated as `this.dm` in constructor (auto-registers message listener)
- Added `dm:` command filter in onMessage to avoid double-handling

### 4. io-package.json
- Added `"supportedMessages": { "deviceManager": true }` to common section

### 5. Existing deviceManager.js preserved (untouched)

### 6. Validation
- node -c syntax check: PASS (main.js, bluetoothDeviceManagement.js)
- io-package.json JSON parse: PASS
- Module load test: PASS (all 5 prototype methods present)
